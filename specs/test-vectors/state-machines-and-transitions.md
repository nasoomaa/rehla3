# Test Vectors: State Machines and Transition Matrices

## 1. Scope and Rule Being Proven

This suite proves the deterministic validation of all state transitions across the platform's state machines: `TopUpStatus` (2 valid transitions) and `ExecutionStatus` (7 standard lifecycle states, strictly validated forward transitions).

---

## 2. Invariants Under Test

1. Terminal states (`approved`, `rejected` for Top-Ups; `completed`, `cancelled` for Executions) can NEVER transition to any other state.
2. Backward transitions are forbidden unless explicitly permitted by the operational workflow (e.g. `action_received` returning to `processing`).
3. Skipping intermediate prerequisite states is forbidden.
4. Transitioning to `action_required` requires non-empty instructions.
5. Transitioning to `completed` requires a linked issued document.
6. Transitioning to `cancelled` requires a non-empty audit rationale.
